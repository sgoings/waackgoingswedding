            <h2>Britt's Side</h2>
              <h3>Julie Tweedt</h3>
                <p>At my high school graduation, a friends mom told me about this girl who I should meet at Central College. Even though I forgot the name, she ended up becoming one of my best friends. She is a great listener and wedding planner extraordinaire. She’s also the one who suggested I look at graduate schools in Colorado, where I eventually met Seth.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Mollie Goings</h3>
                <p>Mollie was the first person I met from Seth's family and she quickly put me at ease. It didn’t take long for me to discover that we would have been friends even if Seth wasn’t in the picture. She commiserates with stories about crazy students and Seth’s teasing antics. We also have a mutual love of scarves. I’m gaining a truly wonderful sister.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Lindsie Blair</h3>
                <p>Lindsie has been my "big sister" since I was in 8th grade.  She has been a great role model despite the fact we lived in different states for several years. I was so excited when she & her family moved to Colorado and we started meeting occasionally for breakfasts together. I appreciate her honesty about life and willingness to share "big sister" wisdom.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Jessica Williams</h3>
                <p>I met Jessica in a bible study at Central College during our freshman year, but that was just the beginning.  We bonded over coffee, studying abroad and few too many games of Nerts during our last semester.  She has been the voice of reason countless times and is always willing to pick me up from the airport when I'm in Iowa.</p>
