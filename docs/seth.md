- saw her at MHV
- small group
-- Jason
-- wanted to talk to her, but she was surrounded by other females
-- first conversation might have been during the small group christmas party, when I was getting tackled, jumped on, etc. by kids
- I'm usually very focused on the task at hand, so eventually I shot Brittany a Facebook message asking if we could hang out. It went something like:
-- mentioned she was a French teacher ... I thought... "Oh do I have some tricks up my sleeve..."
- kitchen organization help +1k points (I knew she was a keeper)
- St. Patrick's day + text + coming over to my apartment (I knew I had her interested)
- showed her around Downtown Denver, my workplace at Tattered Cover
- Asked her to join me in CO Springs for a Hillsong Concert with my sister
-- Mollie told me I had better DTR it up before spending the weekend with her (planned to do it the weekend before the concert)
-- couldn't handle waiting, so Easter 2012 after hanging out with the family all day long, I marched on over to Brittany's place and told her I wanted to get down to business (Business Time).
- Brittany skips over the fact that within a couple months (weeks?) I had dropped the "L" word
-- she freaked out. (Ted Mosby)
-- Eventually, I got to a point where I got frustrated by the fact that she would avoid saying she loved me, yet she acted like she was in for the long haul (I mean... she even survived being peppered by my Uncle Mark WHILE being sick!). Sheeeesh.
- After getting past that hurdle, it has been pretty smooth sailing.
BLAH BLAH BLAH ooey gooey smushy relationship stuff
- Assembled her ring from parts based on a blueprint (like a true engineer) that had been provided from a friend (cough) Julie (cough) just a couple months after starting to date Brittany
- Put together a photo album of sorts (all in InDesign, I might add) [add link]
- had Brittany set up a dinner at my place so our parents "could meet for the first time."
- SHOCK VALUE = perfect

Steve Meyerhoff - Chef, Call of Duty Instructor
Steve and I first met at Mines - we were both into basketball, cooking, religious + science + school discussions, hosting dinners (for only females of course), and playing video games (I was usually terrible, but Seth + a Slurpee or some sort of caffeine is fun for almost anyone). Steve has played a significant role in getting rid of my "nerd curse" (talking to females). For that, I am eternally grateful.

Jason Martinez - Musician, Matchmaker
Jason and I have both played electric guitar at Mile High Vineyard for a while, so we've always had rockin' topics of conversation (ah ah? get it? get it?). I think Jason intentionally worked his sly matchmaking magic behind the scenes until Brittany and I started dating. I appreciate Jason's ability to explain the inner workings (some might say: quirks) of the female brain.

Brad Umbaugh - Computer Whiz, Comedian
Brad and I both took VLI together and began to realize we had a similar sense of humor and perspective on the world. We've bounced software ideas, processes, life, Christianity off each other over lunches in Downtown Denver and late nights listening to Derek Morphew talk about driving out demons in the Eastern Hemisphere. Yeah - you really can't compete with that, can you?

Chris Knudsen - Introvert, Inquisitive
Chris and I bonded over both of our passions to continually learn and think well - we're always looking into how processes and people are working, pointing out inefficiencies and areas of improvement. I've enjoyed having Chris teach me how to ask better questions of myself and others to encourage reflection, realization, and growth. Plus, he's an introvert. What's not to love?
